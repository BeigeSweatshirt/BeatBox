# BeatBox 
BeatBox is not an application for creating musical beats. BeatBox is a soundboard that makes various, threating hollers and roars to intimidate your foes should you need to beat them up : ). BeatBox is based on Android Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide and the challenge exercises therein.
